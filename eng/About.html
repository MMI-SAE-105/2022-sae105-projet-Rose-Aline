<h1>About</h1>

<p>
  To start this first year MMI, we have carried out a personal project on the theme «notes for later», inspired by the famous  song by Orelsan.
  It is precisely on the theme of time that I have focused my realization: the links between present, past and future. These relationships are complex, sometimes positive but often disturbing. 
  It is a way of translating the oppressive aspect of time and fear of the future.
  To illustrate this theme, I chose references from the artistic world: music, films, sculptures, drawings…
  This is an area that particularly touches me, especially in its mysterious dimension.
