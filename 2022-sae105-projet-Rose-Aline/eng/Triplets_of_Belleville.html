  <h1>A wacky era</h1>
  <img src="/public/img/Video_cover.webp" alt="Clickable picture to start the video">

  This film takes us into 
  <b>a delusional and nostalgic world </b>
  by following the misadventures of a strange team of four grannies, their dog and a melancholic cyclist.

  <p>
    The Triplets of Belleville were released in 2003. This animated film directed by
    <a href="https://sylvainchomet.com/sylvain-chomet/">Sylvain Chomet</a> 
    gets several awards and nominations. 
    However, this animation is not really intended for children. 
    In France in the 1950s, we follow the adventures of Grandma Suza and her orphaned grandson, Champion.
    In the company of their big dog Bruno, she will push him in his passion for cycling, until they reach the roads of the Tour de France.
    Mysterious bandits will then kidnap him to take him to the United States. 
    Facing all the dangers, his grandmother goes to rescue him with the help of three former stars of the 1930s, the Triplets of Belleville.

  <h2>A strange world</h2>
  <p>
    This story is an amazing and <b>indescribable mix: humour, worry, joy, repulsionâ€¦</b> 
    It plunges us into a nostalgic universe full of references with a melancholic tone. 
    The animation takes us into a very special world that mixes imagination and reality: the cities of New York and Montreal.
    In addition, personalities are sometimes grotesque, caricatural but always endearing. 
    The virtual absence of dialogue brings out their expressiveness.

  <h2>The wheel of time</h2>
  <p>
    In addition, under the amusement this film invites us  to reflect on time: 
    <b>the impacts of our past on our present</b>
    like the passion of Champion of bike that comes from a memory of his parents or the phobia of trains of the dog Bruno that comes from an ancient trauma.
    In conclusion, time turns and advances like a bicycle wheel.
    The era of the Triplettes still shows its faded splendors and ends in apotheosis with a dazzling chase.
