     <h1>The ball of the end</h1>
     
        The project <b>Everywhere at the end of time de The Caretaker</b> is a musical enigma. 
        This journey to the complete loss of memory makes us lose our memory and our bearings.

        Time flies by. Sometimes the past pursues us, the present escapes us and the future makes us anxious.
        <a href="https://leylandkirby.bandcamp.com/">Leyland Kirby</a> takes us through a labyrinth of time with his album Everywhere at The End of Time. 
        under the name The Caretaker.
        This British composer has created a timeless work that spans six parts released between 2016 and 2019. 
        Thus, the project represents 6 and a half hours of listening in total and mixes sound experiments, collages and noise music.

        by

    <h2>Between memory and forgetfulness</h2>
    <p>
        All that follows is true is one of the songs that starts the album. Itâ€™s one of the most powerful compositions.
        Indeed, it marks the transition from the first to the second stage towards forgetfulness and madness. 
        The artist has mixed the sweetness of a nostalgic music, that of
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurice_Winnick">Maurice Winnick</a>
        ( It Looks Like Rain In Cherry Blossom Lane -1932) and static noises, repetitions, ruptures.
        This mixture creates a feeling of unease while keeping the calm and reassuring aspect of nostalgia.
