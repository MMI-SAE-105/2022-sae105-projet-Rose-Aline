     <h1>The depths of time</h1>

          In the United Arab Emirates, the brand new pool, 
          <b>Deep Dive Dubai</b>
          , is a great playground for divers looking for sensations.  
          <b>With its underwater modern city, it takes us to another dimension of time.</b>

     <p>  
          Dubai inaugurated the deepest pool in the world in July 2021.
          A brand new 1500 m2 building in the shape of a giant oyster welcomes 
          <a href="https://www.deepdivedubai.com/"> Deep Dive Dubai. </a>
          At a depth of 60 metres, it contains 14 million litres of fresh and hot water.
          It is a paradise for divers. It welcomes all levels, from beginner to professional.
          All forms of diving are possible: snorkeling, bottle diving, snorkeling.
          However, it interests me for another reason: its unique and unusual atmosphere.

     <h2>A modern Atlantis</h2>
     <p>
          Deep Dive Dubai transports us to a sunken city where nature gradually takes back its rights. The mythical 
          <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantide">Atlantis</a> 
          is an obvious reference. 
          However, divers will visit the ruins of a contemporary city.
          They can meet an abandoned car, a baby-foot table, arcade games<a href="Glossaire.html"> <img src="/public/icons/i_info.svg" alt="clickable icon to access the glossary and the definition of 'Arcade games'"></a>, fully furnished rooms ready to be discovered. 
          This decor animated by 164 games of lights and sound atmospheres gives a strange impression.
          <b>It seems that our present has become a past and is rediscovered in a future period.</b>
     </p>

     <h2>The end of our time</h2>
     <p>
          Apart from the visitors, this pool contains no other life form, whether animal or vegetable. 
          These elements reinforce the post-apocalyptic
          <a href="Glossaire.html"> <img src="/public/icons/i_info.svg" alt="clickable icon to access the glossary and the definition of 'post-apocalyptic'"></a> atmosphere that reigns there. Putting aside the tourist aspect of this place, this pool represents the mystery of the depths, the anguish of the unknown. 
          In conclusion, <b>it takes us to another dimension.</b>
          This place reminds us that our contemporary era will have an end but that it can also be revived in the future in a new form.
