  <h1>The time to do nothing</h1>

    <img src="/public/img/regret_image_(1).webp" alt="Picture of an hourglass on a table">
    Always in a hurry, ultra-connected… <b>The generation of the 2000s has developed another notion of time</b>, but is it the right concept to build its future?

  <p>
    We are the Generation Z 
    <a href="Glossaire.html"> <img src="/public/icons/i_info.svg" alt="clickable icon to access the glossary and the definition of 'Generation Z'"></a> 
    , born with the development of digital means: internet, smartphones.
    Z for zapping, we have to deal with innumerable information, constant demands.
    As a result, we naturally know how to read our notifications, consult our classes’s notes and listen to our favorite singer’s latest album at the same time. 
    <b>Today, one news story erases another.</b>
    A global pandemic is almost forgotten when a new conflict occurs, which itself will fade behind another buzz or scandal.

  <h2>A fast-track society</h2>
  <p>
    Overall, the society around us pushes us to always go fast, to decide now and immediately. 
    Win  competitions, our duties, our future professional life…
    This avalanche of objectives actually prevents us from taking the time to do nothing.
    The philosopher  
    <a href="https://www.academie-francaise.fr/les-immortels/paul-valery">Paul Valéry</a> 
    (1871 – 1945) wrote,  
    “We can no longer bear the duration. We can no longer fertilize boredom. Our nature abhors emptiness, the emptiness on which the spirits of yesteryear knew how to paint the images of their ideals, their ideas…”
    <b>The time to do nothing no longer exists.</b> 
    The pressure of social networks crushes and encompasses all free time.
    However, we often have the impression of having wasted our time!

  <h2>Not moving at the same pace</h2>
  <p>
    Childhood can seem long and boring. Nevertheless, it will no longer be possible to find these times of reflection to invent a tomorrow.
    <b>Our generation is in a hurry to grow up right away</b>
    at the risk of feeling old before the hour with this unpleasant feeling of running after time.
    We want to do everything now: succeed in our professional, social life, save the planet, revolutionize the future...
    To the extent that we are slower than others, it can sometimes be difficult to keep pace with society and thus meet the expected standards.
