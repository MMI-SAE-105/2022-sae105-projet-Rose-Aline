    <h1>The time to do nothing</h1>

    Telework is a new organization of work. It was born from the health situation caused by the pandemic, but also from the  <b>aspirations of our generation for more freedom and flexibility thanks to digital tools.</b>

    <p>
        For nearly two years, the pandemic has put the world on hold.
        New methods of communication, training and work had to be learned.
        Even if mentalities still have a hard time accepting it,  
        <a href="https://www.insee.fr/fr/statistiques/6209490">teleworking</a>
        is now part of the way we work.
        Our generation has embraced and adapted to this new opportunity.

    <h2>Better professional and personal management</h2>
    <p>
        Personally, I think it is an ideal organization on several levels.
        <b>Telework allows you to manage your time, whether professional or personal, at your own pace. </b>
        You can spend your evening finishing your work and take some time during the day to relax. Also, this organization is more personal friendly. 
        It saves time: commuting, sleep, non-work activities… Studies have shown that 
        <a href="https://www.latribune.fr/economie/france/d-ici-a-20-ans-le-teletravail-pourrait-booster-la-productivite-de-la-france-918205.html">productivity was increased.</a>
        It is actually easier to concentrate without the noise and distractions that interrupt us at the workplace 
        <b> It is also a faster, simpler communication space</b>
        with colleagues who may be geographically distant. 
        These exchanges are then not only professional but also allow to discover other cultures.

    <h2>Mutual trust for tomorrow</h2>
    <p>
        My hope is that telework offers a relationship of mutual trust between employee and employer. 
        I hope that technology will develop to create tools or collaborative  <b>spaces that are even more user-friendly, more efficient and that preserve human relationships.</b> 
        For example, we could imagine all meeting in virtual reality, playing or discussing in the context of work…
